##corr_snps is correlation between snps
#Corr(β_1, β_2) can be approximated by Pearson correlation (h_12) between genetic variants, and this can be estimated in two steps in practice. 
#First, h_12^2, which is LD between genetic variants, can be estimated using LDmatrix Tool in LDlink. 
#Second, effective allele frequency (EAF) is used to decide positive or negative square root of LD,  
#with a positive value assigned if the absolute difference in EAF of two genetic variants is smaller than the absolute difference 
#between EAF of one genetic variant and minor allele frequency (MAF) of the other genetic variant.

##corr_x is correlation between risk factors. 
##This can be estimated as correlation between phenotypes using individual-level data, 
#or correlation between summary statistics of risk factors as a surrogate
